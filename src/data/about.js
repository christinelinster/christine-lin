    I am a software engineer with a background in building and scaling B2B SaaS products.
    `,
    `My path into engineering started at a hackathon in 2020 where my team built Dose,
    an award-winning medication reminder app. That spark led me to a career in tech strategy,
    where I spent over 4 years as Oracle Practice Lead.
    I managed product roadmaps in JIRA,
    collaborated with engineering teams through Agile cycles,
    and shipped cloud-native retail applications to multinational retailers.
`, `
Working closely with engineers made one thing clear: I wanted to build the software myself.
To deepen my technical foundation, I completed Launch School’s mastery-based software engineering
curriculum (1,200+ hours) covering software fundamentals, object-oriented design, system architecture,
and database design.
